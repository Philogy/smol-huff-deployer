# Smol Huff Deployer

Simple contract to help you deploy Huff contracts in foundry tests.

## Why not use `foundry-huff`?
[Foundry Huff](https://github.com/huff-language/foundry-huff) is great, and it's more feature rich,
however it tends to break for me and I don't quite know why. This is very simple and tends to always
work.
